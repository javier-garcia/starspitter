# Starpitter


We developed a special programme based on Processing and called it “starspitter” – in the true sense of the word, it should spit out a lot of stars after all. We fed the programme with the numbers our [MindWave](http://www.neurosky.com) sensor had recorded before. With the help of Processing we visualized the data and therefore also the commonalities and differences of our employees. The result: over 150 generative info graphics in the shape of a deepblue star - our bright shining deepblue star. 

__Starspitter is open source and free for all__





# The Story


If humans personality would be visible, it would be a star. Shining bright like a unique light in the universe. 
We are copywriters, account managers, art directors, concept and web developers, all striving for the best in their own way. 

This christmas we wanted to show these shining characteristics that make us one of a kind.
